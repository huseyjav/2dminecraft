I am making a 2d Minecraft clone

Functionalities will be as following:
    -player with inventory and craft menu etc
    -typical minecraft features such as building, mining blocks
    -day-night cycle
    -weapons: melee, bow
    -portals to different worlds with differnt gravity, environment in single game which can be achieved by changing instance of world class in game class
                                                                                    (thats the reason i have gravity as variable in world class)
    -different kinds of alive entities. Right now I have only local player class prototype but I will make different kinds alive AI entities
