abstract class Renderable that has render function, every object that can be rendered will be derived from this class

theres base class CAlive, we can derive classes such as animal, hostileAI etc from this class

theres base class CEntity for game entities that can move, have velocity etc.

at CEntity update function will be implemented for basic things such as dropped items but for alive players it might be different
thats why it is virtual and in player class it is overwritten to take fall damage into account and as project develops i will probably have more reasons to overwrite
