I am making a 2d Minecraft clone

Functionalities will be as following:
    -player with inventory and craft menu etc
    -typical minecraft features such as building, mining blocks
    -day-night cycle
    -weapons: melee, bow
    -portals to different worlds with differnt gravity, environment in single game which can be achieved by changing instance of world class in game class
                                                                                    (thats the reason i have gravity as variable in world class)
    -different kinds of alive entities. Right now I have only local player class prototype but I will make different kinds alive AI entities
    
    
    abstract class Renderable that has render function, every object that can be rendered will be derived from this class

theres base class CAlive, we can derive classes such as animal, hostileAI etc from this class

theres base class CEntity for game entities that can move, have velocity etc.

at CEntity update function will be implemented for basic things such as dropped items but for alive players it might be different
thats why it is virtual and in player class it is overwritten to take fall damage into account and as project develops i will probably have more reasons to overwrite
